# 10.0.1

#### :bug: Bug Fix

- Fix issue where watch mode would give an error on Windows https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5621

# 10.0.0

**Compiler**

#### :boom: Breaking Change

- `bsconfig.json` does not support `// line` comments anymore.
  - Example: `"suffix": ".bs.js" // determine the suffix`
  - Fix: remove the comment and use standard json.
- Changed return type of `Js.String.match_` as it was wrong. [#5070](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5070)
  - Example: any use of `Js.String.match_` and `Js.String2.match_`
  - Fix: follow the type errors

#### :rocket: New Feature

- New records with optional fields e.g. `type opt = {x: int, y?: string}` were added as an experimental feature [#5423](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5423) [#5452](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/issues/5452) [New Syntax](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/589/files)
- Add support for `@new @variadic` (see https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5364)

#### :bug: Bug Fix

- Classify bigint correctly [#5351](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5351)
- Fixed crash in `rescript build` on Windows [#5516](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5516)
- Fixed `rescript init` command not working [#5526](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5526)
- Fix issue with compiler log not terminated that causes problems with editor extension not clearing issues when fixed [#5545](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/issues/5545)

##### :nail_care: Polish

- Changed Linux build to depend on GLIBC 2.28 again for compatibility with Debian 10.

- Proper M1 support (CI now supports M1 native builds)

**Syntax**

#### :boom: Breaking Change

- `@bs.send.pipe` is now removed. Earlier it was deprecated.
- Missing labels in function application is now an error (https://forum.rescript-lang.org/t/ann-more-strict-checks-in-missed-labels/2117).
  - Example: `let f = (x, ~z) => x + z; f(1, 2)`
  - Fix: do `let f = (x, ~z) => x + z; f(1, ~z=2)` instead
- Externals without `@val` annotations do not work anymore, and externals with `= ""` give an error.
  - Example: `external setTimeout: (unit => unit, int) => float = "setTimeout"` is not supported anymore.
  - Fix: use `@val external setTimeout: (unit => unit, int) => float = "setTimeout"` instead.
  - Example2: `@val external setTimeout: (unit => unit, int) => float = ""` is not supported anymore.
  - Fix2: use `@val external setTimeout: (unit => unit, int) => float = "setTimeout"` instead.
- Strings processed at compile-time don't need escaping anymore.
  - Example: `let blockCommentsRe = %re("/\\/\\*([^*]|[\\r\\n]|(\\*+([^*/]|[\\r\\n])))*\\*+\\//g")`.
  - Fix: use `let blockCommentsRe = %re("/\/\*([^*]|[\r\n]|(\*+([^*/]|[\r\n])))*\*+\//g")` instead.
- Remove parsing of "import" and "export" which was never officially supported https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/597 https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/599
  - Example: `export type t = int`
  - Fix: `@genType type t = int`
  - Example2: `import realValue: complexNumber => float from "./MyMath"`
  - Fix2: `@genType.import("./MyMath") external realValue: complexNumber => float = "realValue"`

#### :rocket: New Feature

- Unicode is now supported in regular strings and chars (when the symbol fits). This is now going to work: `let str = "Σ"`. And, you'll be able to pattern match on unicode chars: `switch c { | 'Σ' => "what a fine unicode char" | _ => "unicode is fun" }`
- Doc comments `/** ... */` are now supported. Inernally, they are attributes, so are only valid at positions where `@foo` is allowed, or a syntax error is given. Similarly for module-level `/*** comments */` that can go where `@@attributes` go.

#### :bug: Bug Fix

- Fix printing for inline nullary functor types [#477](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/477)
- Fix stripping of quotes for empty poly variants [#474](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/474)
- Implement syntax for arity zero vs arity one in uncurried application in [#139](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/139)
- Fix parsing of first class module exprs as part of binary/ternary expr in [#256](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/256)
- Fix formatter hanging on deeply nested function calls [#261](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/issues/261)

**Libraries**

#### :boom: Breaking Change

- **"Attributes not allowed here"**. If you see this error chances are you're using a ppx that needs updating to a new version.
  See an exampe of how to [update a ppx](https://github.com/zth/rescript-relay/pull/372)
  - Example: for `rescript-relay` 0.23.0 is not supported.
  - Fix: use `rescript-relay@beta` or the new version when released.
- Removed printing modules (Printf, Format etc) and related functions. Details of files added/removed: https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/commit/0fd8bb0e77c4b0e96a9647ac8af614305057003f.

#### :bug: Bug Fix

- Fix library issue with missing `bytes_to_string` https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/issues/5573 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5589

#### :nail_care: Polish

- Several Belt / Js libraries are now converted to ReScript syntax, with corresponding comments in Markdown format suitable for hovering. See [#5361](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5361).

**Playground**

#### :house: Internal

- Added `jsoo_playground_main.ml` as the rescript-lang.org playground bundle entrypoint

#### :boom: Breaking Change

- Removed Reason syntax support for the playground experience. See https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5375

# 9.1.4

## Build

- #5167 add dump subcommand so that

```
rescript dump path/to/file.cmi
```

Will dump the interface to a readable output, note this is integrated into the build system that the build will try to build it if it is not already there

- clean will clean its dependency by default.
  subcommand `clean -with-deps`, `-with-deps` is not needed any more
- hide most bsc options, officially supported bsc flags (this is not a breaking change, those internal options are still there but subject to removal in the future)

```
Usage: bsc <options> <files>
Options are:
Options:
  -w                        <list>  Enable or disable warnings according to <list>:

  -version                  Print version and exit
  -warn-help                Show description of warning numbers
  -warn-error               <list>  Enable or disable error status for warnings according
                            to <list>.  See option -w for the syntax of <list>.

  what ocaml style class is, this should not affect them.

# 9.0.2

- #4990 Fix an optimization bug introduced in 9.0

- #4982 pattern match over modules

Provide user with a sugar to pattern match over modules:

```res
let {length, cons} = module(List)
```

More discussions can be found [here](https://forum.rescript-lang.org/t/introducing-an-extension-to-make-pattern-match-works-on-modules/1196)

# 9.0

- #4933 update syntax bf6561bb5d84
  syntax changes listed [here](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#90)
- #4934 generate `@pure` annotations to help esbuild remove more dead code

- #4932 #4931 turn flow syntax checking from a error into warning 103, so it can be turned off as below

```res
@@config({
  flags: ["-w", "-103"],
})

%%raw(`
if (import.meta.hot){
  console.log('es6')
}
`)
```

The rationale is that flow could be not standard compilant so we need provide a work around, here
`import.meta` is something new in Ecmascript

- #4926 #4928
  _internal_ changes, move jscomp/syntax to jscomp/frontend to avoid conflicts

- #4924 #4927 better code generated for pattern match.

- #4908 #4919 #4917 #4916 #4914 #4913 #4910
  Get rid of camlp4 as a dev dependency, introduce an optimized visitor pattern
  generator, better performance, no object usage and less dependency thanks to wasm

- #4911 Relax uninterpretable attributes from error to warn to make ppx_deriving happy

- #4905 _internal_ add `Js_exn.anyToExnInternal`

- #4903 porting to open BSD/adJ

- #4902 for stdlib es6 artifacts ship .mjs instead of .js, so that
  on the user side, if they config es6 with .mjs, it will work out of box

- #4900 #4986 `'` in string literals does not need to be escaped

- #4893 _internal_ simplify numbers in JS IR

- #4870 fix typo in uncurried error message

- #4867 _internal_ clean up bsb_helper

# 8.4.2

- #4864 #4865
  Not install dev directory for pinned dependencies
- #4863
  for a package, only cmi/cmj artifact changes will trigger a rebuild

# 8.4.1

- Syntax submodule upgrades from 7f5c968 to 7cc70c9
- #4856 #4858
  Improve code generation for pattern match:
  Input:

  ```res
  type t =
    | A
    | B
    | C
    | D (int )
    | E (int)

  let f = x => {
    switch x {
        | A => 0
        | B => 1
        | C => 2
        | D (x) => x
        | E (x) => x + 1
    }
  }
  ```

  Output was:

  ```js
    function f(x) {
      if (typeof x !== "number") {
        if (x.TAG) {
        return x._0 + 1 | 0;
      } else {
        return x._0;
      }

      switch (x) {
        case /* A */0 :
          return 0;
        case /* B */1 :
          return 1;
        case /* C */2 :
          return 2;
    }
  }
  ```

  Now:

  ```js
  function f(x) {
    if (typeof x !== "number") {
      if (x.TAG === /* D */ 0) {
        return x._0;
      } else {
        return (x._0 + 1) | 0;
      }
    }
    switch (x) {
      case /* A */ 0:
        return 0;
      case /* B */ 1:
        return 1;
      case /* C */ 2:
        return 2;
    }
  }
  ```

# 7.1.0

(it was 7.0.2 but bumped into 7.1.0 due to a breaking change introduced in 7.0.2)

- #4131 support `bstracing -C`

# 7.0.2

- #4117 Upgrade to Reason 3.6.0 @ 8f71db0
- #4097 introduce a js parser for syntax checking inside raw.

  We can now tell whether the code inside raw is a function or not and the arity of raw function, so

  ```ocaml
  let f = [%raw{|function(x){return x}|}]
  ```

  ```ocaml
  let f = fun%raw x -> {|x|}
  ```

  will be treated the same, to make FFI simpler, the special form `fun%raw` will be discouraged.

- #4090 #4087 fix the unsoundess issue of Js.Array.push
