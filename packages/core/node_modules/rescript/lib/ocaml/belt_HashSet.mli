(**
  A **mutable** Hash set which allows customized `hash` behavior.

  All data are parameterized by not its only type but also a unique identity in
  the time of initialization, so that two _HashSets of ints_ initialized with
  different _hash_ functions will have different type.

  For example:

  ```res prelude
  module I0 = unpack(
    Belt.Id.hashableU(
      ~hash=(. a: int) => land(a, 65535),
      ~eq=(. a, b) => a == b,
    )
  )

  let s0 = Belt.HashSet.make(~id=module(I0), ~hintSize=40)

  module I1 = unpack(
    Belt.Id.hashableU(
      ~hash=(. a: int) => land(a, 255),
      ~eq=(. a, b) => a == b,
    )
  )

  let s1 = Belt.HashSet.make(~id=module(I1), ~hintSize=40)

  Belt.HashSet.add(s1, 0)
  Belt.HashSet.add(s1, 1)
  ```

  The invariant must be held: for two elements who are equal, their hashed
  value should be the same.

  Here the compiler would infer `s0` and `s1` having different type so that it
  would not mix.

  ```res sig
  let s0: Belt.HashSet.t<int, I0.identity>
  let s1: Belt.HashSet.t<int, I1.identity>
  ```

  We can add elements to the collection (see last two lines in the example
  above). Since this is an mutable data structure, `s1` will contain two pairs.

    than the generic type *)
module Int = Belt_HashSetInt

(* TODO: add a poly module
   module Poly = Belt_HashSetPoly
   challenge:
   - generic equal handles JS data structure
   - eq/hash consistent
