`assign(target, source)` copies properties from source to target.
Properties in `target` will be overwritten by properties in `source` if they have the same key.
Returns `target`.

**See** [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)

```res example
/* Copy an object */

let obj = {"a": 1}

let copy = Js.Obj.assign(Js.Obj.empty(), obj)

/* prints "{ a: 1 }" */
Js.log(copy)

/* Merge objects with same properties */

let target = {"a": 1, "b": 1}
let source = {"b": 2}

let obj = Js.Obj.assign(target, source)

/* prints "{ a: 1, b: 2 }" */
Js.log(obj)

/* prints "{ a: 1, b: 2 }", target is modified */
Js.log(target)
```

   Should we map this API as directly as possible, provide some abstractions, or deliberately nerf it?
