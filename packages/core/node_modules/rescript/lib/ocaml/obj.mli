external field : t -> int -> t = "%obj_field"

(** When using flambda:

    [set_field] MUST NOT be called on immutable blocks.  (Blocks allocated
    in C stubs, or with [new_block] below, are always considered mutable.)

    The same goes for [set_double_field] and [set_tag].  However, for
    [set_tag], in the case of immutable blocks where the middle-end optimizers
    never see code that discriminates on their tag (for example records), the
    operation should be safe.  Such uses are nonetheless discouraged.

    For experts only:
    [set_field] et al can be made safe by first wrapping the block in
    {!Sys.opaque_identity}, so any information about its contents will not
    be propagated.
