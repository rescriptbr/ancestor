(** The initially opened module.

   This module provides the basic operations over the built-in types
   (numbers, booleans, byte sequences, strings, exceptions, references,
   lists, arrays, input-output channels, ...).

   This module is automatically opened at the beginning of each compilation.
   All components of this module can therefore be referred by their short
   name, without prefixing them by [Pervasives].

   even if the two mutable objects are not the same physical object.
   Equality between functional values raises [Invalid_argument].

external compare : 'a -> 'a -> int = "%compare"
(** [compare x y] returns [0] if [x] is equal to [y],
   a negative integer if [x] is less than [y], and a positive integer

   is compatible with the comparison predicates [=], [<] and [>]
   defined above,  with one difference on the treatment of the float value
   {!Pervasives.nan}.  Namely, the comparison predicates treat [nan]
   as different from any other float value, including itself;
   while [compare] treats [nan] as equal to itself and less than any
   other float value.  This treatment of [nan] ensures that [compare]
   defines a total ordering relation.

   [compare] applied to functional values may raise [Invalid_argument].
   [compare] applied to cyclic structures may not terminate.

   The [compare] function can be used as the comparison function

   [e1 == e2] is true if and only if physical modification of [e1]
   also affects [e2].
   On non-mutable types, the behavior of [( == )] is

(** {1 Floating-point arithmetic}

   OCaml's floating-point numbers follow the
   IEEE 754 standard, using double precision (64 bits) numbers.
   Floating-point operations never raise an exception on overflow,
   underflow, division by zero, etc.  Instead, special IEEE numbers
   are returned as appropriate, such as [infinity] for [1.0 /. 0.0],
   [neg_infinity] for [-1.0 /. 0.0], and [nan] ('not a number')
   for [0.0 /. 0.0].  These special numbers then propagate through
   floating-point computations as expected: for instance,
   [1.0 /. infinity] is [0.0], and any arithmetic operation with [nan]
   as argument returns [nan] as result.

   exceeds the range of integers representable in type [int]. *)
